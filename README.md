# Small code showcases
there is 4 files, in this repo, I try to keep things simple in my projects so I don't have very complex files but
modular applications with simple logic in each component to make them easy to understand, although I tried to make this
small compilation of some scripts, I consider they have something interesting at least

- Signup.js, a React signup component with some validation logic
- ApiUtils.js, a very basic file for API requests using axios
- binance_scrapping.py, a script that scrapes binance data
- api_backend_utils.py, functions for Django REST framework utils
- flask_api.py, small api routing and logic in flask
